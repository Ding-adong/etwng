To use converters you need:

Step 1.
Install JRuby.
You can download it from: http://jruby.org/download

Step 2.
Install nokogiri gem.
Double click on install_nokogiri.bat in this directory
or from command line run: jgem install nokogiri --pre

Step 3. [NO LONGER NEEDED]
lzma.exe from LZMA SDK is included in the repository
for your convenience now, so you don't need to do anything about that.
(this is used only to mod new Shogun 2 Total War files,
for Empire Total War and Napoleon Total War it's optional)
If for any reason you need another version,
you can download it from http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html

== Linux and OSX ==

Converters work with either JRuby on standard Ruby.

Whichever you installed you need to install gem nokogiri, with either:
# Ruby
$ sudo gem install nokogiri
# JRuby
$ sudo jgem install nokogiri --pre

Then install lzma command, in either lzma or p7zip package for your distribution.
If you cannot find it in your distribution, check here - http://www.7-zip.org/download.html
